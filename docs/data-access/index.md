# Data Access

## Getting Access to the Data
The NCATS N3C Data Use Agreement is now available, allowing researchers to submit or join a project in the N3C Data Enclaveâ€”one of the largest, most secure clinical data resources for accelerating and collaborating on COVID-19 research. Below is a brief overview of the process, along with additional resources to help get started. Please consider forwarding this message to researchers within your community who may also wish to access the N3C Data Enclave for COVID-19 research.
