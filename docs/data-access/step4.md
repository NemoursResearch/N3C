## Step 4: Submit the Data Use Request (DUR) Form:

When you are ready to propose a project or join an approved project, complete and submit
the data user request form within the [NCATS N3C Data Enclave](https://auth.ncats.nih.gov/_api/v2/auth/login?redirect_uri=https://auth.ncats.nih.gov/_api/v2/auth/palantir/palantir_unite/saml&client=palantir_unite&tenant=palantir&protocol=saml). We recommend researchers review the DUR ([sample](https://ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_N3C_Sample_Data_Use_Request.pdf)) to ensure that you are prepared to provide the requested information.

During this process, you will read and attest to the [NCATS N3C Data Use Agreement (DUA)](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c/resources/data-access) and the [N3C Data User Code of Conduct](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c/resources/data-user-code-of-conduct). If requesting access to the limited dataset, you will need to upload their institution’s IRB determination letter.

### Draft your Data Use Request Application

**Research Projects Require:**

* Title

* Project Description (must be COVID-19 Related)

* Project Rationale
  - The project rationale is used by the Data Access Committee, (DAC) to
assess the level of data/data tier being requested (Limited Data Set (LDS), De-Identified (DeID), or Synthetic. You should describe the minimum necessary level of data needed to conduct research.

| Access Level | Level 1 - Synthetic                                             | Level 2 - Deidentified Data | Level 2b - Deidentified Data               | Level 3 - LDS |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Type    | Synthetic Data                                                      | Aggregate Data (ie. summary statistics)                           | HIPPA Safe Harbor                                                  | HIPPA Limited Data Set                                                 |
| Description  | Computational data derivative statistically resembles original data | Counts and summary statistics representing 10 or more individuals | Data stripped of 18 direct identifiers called out in the HIPPA Privacy Rule | Data that is stripped of all PHI under HIPPA except dates and zip code |


**Data Levels or Tiers**

* IRB Letter of Determination (LDS Only)
  - If requesting access to the limited dataset, you must upload a PDF copy of your institution’s IRB determination letter for your project
