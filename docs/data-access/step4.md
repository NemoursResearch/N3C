## Step 4: Submit the Data Use Request (DUR) Form


**If you are joining an existing project with a DUR, you may skip this step and move on. If you intend to create a new project, you must follow along with this step to submit a DUR.**

In order to get access to the N3C data investigators need to submit an online application called a Data Use Request or DUR.
This guide outlines the steps for an investigator to submit a DUR for a new project or submit a DUR to join and existing project.

When you are ready to propose a project, complete and submit the data user request form within the [NCATS N3C Data Enclave](https://auth.ncats.nih.gov/_api/v2/auth/login?redirect_uri=https://auth.ncats.nih.gov/_api/v2/auth/palantir/palantir_unite/saml&client=palantir_unite&tenant=palantir&protocol=saml){:target="_blank"}. We recommend researchers review the DUR to ensure that you are prepared to provide the requested information.

During this process, you will read and attest to the [NCATS N3C Data Use Agreement](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c/resources/data-access){:target="_blank"} ([sample DUA](https://ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_N3C_Data_Use_Agreement.pdf){:target="_blank"}) and the [N3C Data User Code of Conduct](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c/resources/data-user-code-of-conduct){:target="_blank"}. If requesting access to the limited dataset, you will need to upload their institution’s IRB determination letter.

__IMPORTANT!__ Read the [checklist](https://covid.cd2h.org/Enclave_Registration_Checklist){:target="_blank"} before starting the Data Use Request (DUR) process

## Overview of the DUR Process
* Investigator submits a Data Use Request.
* Data Access Committee (DAC) Reviews and Approves the research project
* Investigators are given access to the analytics workbench

## Drafting the DUR Application

**All Research Projects Require:**

* Title
* Project Description (must be COVID-19 Related)
* Project Rationale
> *The project rationale is used by the Data Access Committee, (DAC) to assess the [level of data/data tier](https://nemoursresearch.github.io/N3C/data-access/#access-levels){:target="_blank"} being requested (Limited Data Set (LDS), De-Identified (DeID), or Synthetic. You should describe the minimum necessary level of data needed to conduct research.*

**Data Level/Tier Requirements:**

* IRB Letter of Determination (LDS Only)
> *If requesting access to the [limited dataset](https://nemoursresearch.github.io/N3C/data-access/#access-levels){:target="_blank"}, you must upload a PDF copy of your institution’s IRB determination letter for your project.*
