# About N3C

The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) was formed under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the NIH.

According to their [website](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c "Website"):

> "The N3C is a partnership among the NCATS-supported Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program hubs and the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H)(link is external), with overall stewardship by NCATS. Collaborators will contribute and use COVID-19 clinical data to answer critical research questions to address the pandemic."
