## Letter from the NCATS N3C Team

> Dear DUA Signee,  
>
> NCATS and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) are pleased to announce the official opening of the N3C Data Enclave on September 1, 2020!
>
> An NCATS N3C webpage was created to provide program resources and governance documents, such as the Data Transfer Agreement (DTA), Data Use Agreement (DUA), User Code of Conduct, and frequently asked questions relating to governance, as well as information on required NIH security training, acknowledging N3C in publications and presentations, and guiding principles for engaging with the community.
>
> In parallel, the N3C website provides information for registering to N3C/CD2H; creating an account and entering the N3C Data Enclave; individual workstream, subgroup, and task team information; as well as frequently asked questions for data access and use. There are also dashboards and N3C project lists currently being created to allow for collaboration and engagement.
>
> N3C has also made materials available for public view through Zenodo, a general-purpose open-access repository: the N3C IRB protocol, Community Guiding Principles, Attribution and Publication Principles for N3C among others with more to come.
>
> CD2H and NCATS have partnered to quickly build this important national resource to study the COVID pandemic. We are enormously grateful for the communities across the CTSAs and the common data models that have rallied with us to make this possible. We are excited about what we and our partners can learn from this shared resource and are confident that this can advance our collaborative efforts to address this health crisis.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> NCATS N3C TEAM
