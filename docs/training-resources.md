# Training Resources
The collaborative has a diverse and growing list of training resources for new and experienced users alike. This includes public introductory & explanatory videos as well as guided tutorials & documentation for enclave users.

## Orientation Lectures
The National Center for Data to Health hosted a two lecture orientation series in the beginning of February which is now available on YouTube. These lectures serve as a good starting point for people looking to get involved in N3C research, providing a general overview of the collaborative and working in the Enclave.

These sessions are now hosted bi-weekly for anyone hoping to learn more about the Enclave.
