    <summary><strong>Acute Kidney Injury in Pediatric COVID-19 Patients</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>Adult patients with COVID-19 have a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). The cause of AKI is multifactorial and is hypothesized to include direct viral injury and inflammation of the kidneys, pre-existing conditions conferring a higher risk, and treatment sequelae such as nephrotoxic medications. The purpose of this study is to better characterize acute kidney injury in pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with and without COVID-19. Specifically we request Level 2 (de-identified) data to ask the following questions: 1) What is the incidence of AKI among pediatric patients, both with and without COVID-19; 2) What risk factors predict the development of AKI in pediatric COVID-19 patients; 3) What are the outcomes of patients with and without AKI; 4) What is the time-course of AKI resolution; and 5) How are treatments, including medication and technology (e.g. CRRT or ECMO) associated with AKI progression or resolution. These final three questions will stratify AKI by KDIGO severity criteria.</i>

    <summary><strong>Contribution of Race and other Social Determinants of Health to Disparities in Patient Outcomes in COVID-19</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed and increasing data has become available on patient outcomes, a striking pattern has emerged: Black and Hispanic Americans exhibit disproportionately high rates of positive diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths. These disparities, which have been demonstrated across the country, have generated significant concern. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain them, addressing a wide range of topics from individual physiology to unequal access to care, but they remain incompletely understood. We aim to use the N3C Limited Data Set to better characterize these disparities and to investigate how various patient- and community-level factors may be contributing to them.</i>

    <summary><strong>Examining Associations between Vitamin D Status and COVID-19 Test Results</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>There is strong evidence from pre-COVID-19 data that vitamin D treatment decreases the incidence of viral respiratory tract infection, especially in vitamin D deficiency. Initial analysis indicates that vitamin D might also protect against COVID-19, but additional studies are urgently needed, ideally using large multi-site datasets. Our objective is to examine whether vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, is associated with COVID-19 test results among data in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) enclave, and to submit findings for peer review by October 31, 2020. We will examine whether a patient?s most recent vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing is associated with their first COVID-19 test result with the use of multi-variable statistical models that mitigate potential confounding. This work will attempt to replicate our initial smaller-sample, single-site findings of associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19 test results, published in JAMA Network Open on September 3, 2020 (Meltzer et al. 2020). If we do not find similar results to our earlier analysis, we will seek to understand the reasons for different findings. If we do find similar results to our earlier analysis, it would increase confidence in our earlier findings to inform current decision making and provide further support for robust prospective studies.</i>
