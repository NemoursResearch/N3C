# Domain Teams
N3C Domain Teams enable researchers with shared interests to analyze data within the N3C Data Enclave and collaborate more efficiently in a team science environment. Teams are comprised of clinical and subject matter experts, statisticians, informaticists and machine learning specialists. Visit the [Data Enclave Domain Teams page](https://covid.cd2h.org/domain-teams){:target="_blank"} for more information on the domain teams currently in session as well as information on how to get involved.

## Example teams

Listed below are descriptions of some of the teams. Visit the [Data Enclave Domain Teams page](https://covid.cd2h.org/domain-teams){:target="_blank"} for a complete list of teams and more information on each (click to expand):

    <summary><strong>Pediatrics</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>The Pediatrics Clinical Domain Team aims to study the unique impact of COVID-19 on children from birth to young adulthood.

    <summary><strong>Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>The goal of the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) Clinical Domain Team is to identify at least three questions that either validate current research or answer new questions for the following categories: local policy around COVID-19, impact of groups experiencing resource challenges, and impact of the pandemic on inequalities.</i>

  <details style="margin-bottom: 20px">
    <summary><strong>Immunosuppressed or Compromised (ISC)</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>The Immunosuppressed/Compromised (ISC) Clinical Domain Team aims to gain a better understanding of how COVID-19 affects patient populations with suppressed or compromised immune systems. The initial research will focus on a subset of target populations, including persons with HIV, solid organ transplant patients, and patients with autoimmune disorders, including skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. The team will also identify areas of research for the ISC populations that will require additional in-depth study at a level that the N3C data may not be able to provide. Through this research, a better understanding will be gained for how various types, levels, and durations of immunosuppression or compromise contribute towards ISC patient outcomes upon COVID-19 infection.</i>

    <summary><strong>Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>The Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Clinical Domain Team aims to investigate risk factors associated with kidney injury and recovery, as well as use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in kidney disease. Their research involves the assessment of risk factors, predictors, duration, dialysis need and timing, clinical measures, and interventions for COVID-19-related complications of the kidney. The team also collaborates with other nephrology domain experts.</i>

    <summary><strong>Diabetes & Obesity</strong></summary>
    <br>
    <div style="padding-left: 20px">
      <i>The Diabetes and Obesity Clinical Domain Team aims to address questions regarding who among people with diabetes and/or obesity are likely to experience poor outcomes in the setting of COVID-19. Though hundreds of papers have been written on this topic, most involve small sample size, single centers, international data resources or other characteristics that leave unanswered questions. Three protocols have been drafted to examine: (1) Effect of glycemic control on COVID-19 outcomes, (2) COVID-19 outcomes as a function of metformin use, and (3) Comparative effectiveness research on COVID-19 outcomes as a function of antihyperglycemic medication use at baseline. The overall goal is to evaluate baseline factors for effects on COVID-19 outcomes in diabetes.</i>
